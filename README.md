# Introduction
This competition is organized in the context of the "Introduction to Machine Learning" course (ELEN0062-1) at the University of Li√®ge, Belgium. The goal is to let you apply the methods and principles exposed in the theoretical course in order to address a real problem: **pass prediction** during football matches.

# Task
The mission of your group, should you decide to accept it, is to use (supervised) learning techniques to design a model able to predict the next player who will receive the ball via a pass based on the position of all players and the ball at a given time.

To achieve this, we provide you with a set of `8682` samples (passes) with the player positions, who are the sending and receiving players. A test set of `3000` unlabeled data is provided for which we ask you to provide the next player who will receive the ball via a pass.

A more precise description of the data is available in the Data section.

Note that you can not use any information outside of those provided (see more in the Rules section).

# Organization
The competition follows the same guidelines as the previous projects, ***i.e.***, a written report and codes must be submitted before the deadline on the Montefiore Submission Platform. The competition will end a couple of days before the deadline in order to let you add your latest results in the report. You can find more information here.


# Acknowledgment
This challenge is inspired from the Football Pass Prediction Challenge of the 5th Workshop on Machine Learning and Data Mining for Sports Analytics.
